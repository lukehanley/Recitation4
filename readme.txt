You are given 3 files: main.cpp, LinkedList.cpp, and LinkedList.hpp

Complete the following functions:

searchList()
	Search for a specified key and return a pointer to that node
swapNodes()
	Swap the last two nodes in the Linked List (don't just swap the values). Swap the nodes.
	You will not receive credit if you swap the values.

The test cases are in main.cpp.

Once you're finished, zip your solution and attach it to the Recitation 4 Dropbox.
